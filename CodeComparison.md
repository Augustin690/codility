Key Aspects of Your Code
Correctness:

It works well for all cases, including when A contains only negative numbers, when all integers are consecutive, or when there are gaps in the sequence.
Time Complexity:

The if n not in A operation has a time complexity of 
𝑂
(
𝑁
)
because in checks for membership in a list.
Since the while loop runs 
𝑂
(
max
(
𝐴
)
)

 times, and for each iteration we potentially do an 
𝑂
(
𝑁
)
membership check, the total complexity is approximately 
𝑂
(
𝑁
×
max
(
𝐴
)
)
This is inefficient for large arrays or arrays with large values of max(A).
Space Complexity:

This implementation uses 
𝑂
(
1
)
 additional space, apart from the input array. This is memory efficient.


Large Maximum Value in A:

If A contains a very large number, say 
1
0
**
6
 , the while loop will run up to 
1
0
**
6

  iterations, even for small arrays. For each iteration, the in check requires scanning the entire array, resulting in poor performance.
Efficiency Trade-Off:

The set approach in my implementation ensures faster lookups, making it more efficient for larger datasets.

How Python Sets Work
A Python set is implemented using a hash table, which is a data structure that maps keys to their hashed values. This allows for very fast insertions, deletions, and membership checks.

Hashing: Each element in the set is passed through a hash function to generate a unique hash value (an integer). This hash value determines where the element is stored in the hash table.
Direct Access: Once the hash value is computed, the element can be located in the hash table directly, without scanning the entire table.

### **Time Complexity of Set Operations**

1. **Insertion**: O(1) on average.
    
    - Adding an element to a set requires calculating its hash value and storing it in the corresponding "bucket" in the hash table.
        
    - If two elements produce the same hash (a rare event called a **collision**), Python handles it efficiently using linked lists or other structures.
        
2. **Deletion**: O(1) on average.
    
    - Removing an element works similarly to insertion: compute the hash value and locate the element directly.
        
3. **Lookup**: O(1) on average.
    
    - When you check `element in set`, Python computes the hash of the `element` and directly checks the corresponding bucket in the hash table. This avoids iterating through the entire set, as would be required in a list.
        
4. **Worst-Case Scenario**: O(N).
    
    - In rare cases where there are many hash collisions (due to a poor hash function or adversarial inputs), the hash table degrades into a linked list, making operations O(N)
        
    - . However, Python's hash table implementation is highly optimized, and this is extremely uncommon in practice.

Why Sets Are More Efficient for Membership Checks Than Lists
Lists:

Membership checks (element in list) require a linear search.
The worst-case time complexity is 
𝑂
(
𝑁
)
, as every element must be examined.
Sets:

Membership checks (element in set) use the hash table, giving an average time complexity of 
𝑂
(
1
).
Even for large datasets, set lookups are highly efficient compared to list searches.

*Summary of Set Efficiency*

Hashing enables sets to perform lookups in 
𝑂
(
1
)
 average time.
Sets are especially beneficial for tasks involving repeated membership checks, such as the problem you posed.
The tradeoff is that sets use more memory than lists due to the hash table structure, but this is generally acceptable for modern systems.
By using a set in your function, we reduce the membership check complexity from 
𝑂
(
𝑁
)
 (with lists) to 
𝑂
(
1
)
 on average, making the overall solution highly efficient for large arrays.
